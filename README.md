# Minimum Triangle Paths
This problem was asked by Suprnation company as a interview question. 

To run the code, use the following command:

#### sbt run

To run the tests, use the following command:

#### sbt test

For simplicity I added sample data files in the resources folder and they are read by main function.
The output of the program is the minimum path sum for the given triangle.
