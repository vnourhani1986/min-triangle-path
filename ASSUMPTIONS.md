# Minimum Triangle Paths

This Problem is a combination of two problems:

1. Create a minimum Triangle from the given triangle
2. Reconstruct the path from the minimum triangle

## Assumptions

1. The input is a valid triangle. It means that the app can't handle broken samples.
2. The input is a list of lists of integers
3. The input is not empty
4. The input is a valid triangle (i.e. the number of elements in each row is one more than the number of elements in the previous row)
5. The input is a valid triangle (i.e. the number of elements in the first row is one)

## Notes
If there are two minimum paths, it just returns one of them.
